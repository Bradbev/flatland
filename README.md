# Flatland
Flatland is an attempt at writing a game-dev IDE using Go, imgui and Ebitengine.
I chose 2D because it is at least an order of magnitude less effort than 3D.
See quickstart.md if you just want to start trying stuff.

I've shamelessly stolen key ideas from Unreal, such as:

# Separate builds for standalone games and editor builds
Packages are organized such that `editor` depends on the game.  The game part
does not need to use anything from the editor package, or from `imgui` if you
don't want to.  

# Easy editing of user defined assets
If you register a struct with the `asset` package (`asset.RegisterAsset`), then
the `editor` package will let you create and edit the exported fields of the struct.
Likewise it is trivial to load assets with `asset.Load`, this loading will
recursively load any assets that are linked.

# Custom asset editors are easy to write
If you know a little imgui, you can write custom editors for your types, see
`image_ed.go` for an example.

# Actors and Components
You are not required to use the design style in the `flat` package.  You may
only want to use the `asset` and `editor` packages.  The design of `flat`
intends to be very data-driven which results in being able to build composite
objects in the editor.

Basically everything in the game should be an `Actor` - something that has a
`Transform2D` and exists in the world.  There are various interfaces an Actor
can implement (`Drawable`,`Updateable`,`Playable`) to be hooked into the main game
loop.  Your own `Actors` can embed `ActorBase` to get the default behaviours.
`Components` are a way to implement features - a composition over inheritance
pattern.  You can dynamically attach `Components` to `Actors` in the editor and
they will start ticking/drawing/etc.
